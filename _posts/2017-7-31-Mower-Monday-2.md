title: Mower Monday &#58 2-Making the Circuit Diagram  
---

Where's Mower Monday 1? Well, that was last week but setting up Jekylle was my post for that.

I've decided to start documenting my Autonomous lawnmower project with this blog. My good friend [Aaron](https://afchacks.wordpress.com/) has been a massive help to the project!

My goal is to keep this [wiki](https://github.com/kyesh/robot-mower-chassis/wiki) as the go to source for all information on the base chasis for this project.

So I started using draw.io but it appears I can't connect multiple nodes together which makes wiring things in parelle impossible.

Now I'm starting on [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) which i used in the past and can make very nice wiring diagrams but I'm not sure about traditinal circuit diagrams.
